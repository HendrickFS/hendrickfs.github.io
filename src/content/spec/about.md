I'm a Master's student in Informatics at the Polytechnic Institute of Bragança - Portugal, in a double-degree program with Computer Science Bachelor at Federal Technological University of Paraná - Brasil. My research fields are Digital Twin, Internet of Things and Cyber-Physical Systems. This site is a collection of my academic work, my studies or my personal projects. I hope you find something useful. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me by [email](mailto:hendrickfel@gmail.com).
